# powerhouse
github/uv project manager for managing projects &amp; virtual enviornments and for being diskspace efficient.
project is written in Rust for the best performance and for security reasons. 
Powerhouse adopted by my original named character (Vizonex Battery) and would be the equivilent of 
his house (if he had one). 

## Inspiration comes from
- cherry-picker
- uv
- The number of projects I maintain or decide to make has readily began increasing and in order to make things
  less difficult for me to navigate I came to the conclusion that a new tool would help with organizing and
  reducing headaches.

## What can this project manager do?
- Help with installation and setup of some projects as well as collection of requirements.txt files
- Forking other people's projects which can take care of some pretty difficult commands that may be
  hard for beginners of git to wrap their heads around)
- Increase productivity allow you to spend more time writing code vs asking ai or the internet for
  a solution when were talking about git commands
- Zipping up projects into zstd or 7zip formats when diskspace is wanted or needed.
- Moving projects to USB drives whenever you need to peform a move
  (Concept is simillar to moving houses.)
- Cleaning
  - If your on windows this will include cleaning up diskspace after tools such as pre-commit & VSCode (which are sometimes bigger symptoms for diskspace eating).
  - cleaning up after uv if a certain version of python is no longer nessesary (Example might be using 3.14 free-threaded temporarly)
